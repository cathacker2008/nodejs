# Multi-Process 
In Node.js, multi-process handling is typically used to perform tasks in parallel across multiple CPU cores, enhancing the performance and efficiency of applications. Node.js provides built-in modules like child_process and cluster to create and manage child processes.

在Node.js中，多进程处理通常用于在多个CPU核心上并行执行任务，以提高应用程序的性能和效率。Node.js内置的child_process模块和cluster模块可以帮助你创建和管理子进程。

## create child processes using the `child_process` Module

###  exec - child_process.exec
The exec method is used to run shell commands and buffers the output in memory. It’s suitable for running simple shell commands.

```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');

exec('ls -l', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
    return;
  }

  if (stderr) {
    console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
    return;
  }

  console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
});
```
Advantages: Simple and easy to use, ideal for executing short commands.
Disadvantages: Since the output is buffered in memory, it might cause memory issues when handling large data.

### spawn - child_process.spawn 

The spawn method is used to start a new process and can handle data streams. It’s ideal for processes with large outputs or those that need to run for an extended period.

```javascript
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

const ls = spawn('ls', ['-l']);

ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
});

ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
  console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
});

ls.on('close', (code) => {
  console.log(`Child process exited with code ${code}`);
});
```
Advantages: Handles large amounts of data efficiently, suitable for long-running tasks.
Disadvantages: Requires manual handling of input/output streams, slightly more complex.

### fork - child_process.fork

fork is a specialized version of spawn, specifically designed for creating Node.js child processes. It creates a child process that can communicate with the parent process via IPC (Inter-Process Communication), making it ideal for distributing tasks within a Node.js application.

```javascript
// parent.js
const { fork } = require('child_process');

const child = fork('./child.js');

child.on('message', (msg) => {
  console.log('Message from child', msg);
});

child.send({ hello: 'world' });

// child.js
process.on('message', (msg) => {
  console.log('Message from parent:', msg);
  process.send({ foo: 'bar' });
});
```
Advantages: Designed for Node.js, allows easy task distribution and communication between processes.
Disadvantages: Slightly more complex, similar to spawn

## create child processes using the `cluster` Module

The cluster module is designed specifically for creating multi-process Node.js servers. It enables you to take full advantage of multi-core CPUs by creating multiple child processes.

```javascript
const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  // Master process that distributes work to child processes
  console.log(`Master ${process.pid} is running`);

  // Fork workers equal to the number of CPU cores
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
  });
} else {
  // Worker process that handles HTTP requests
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end(`Hello World\n from Worker ${process.pid}`);
  }).listen(8000);

  console.log(`Worker ${process.pid} started`);
}
```
cluster.isMaster: Checks if the current process is the master process. If it is, it forks multiple child processes.
cluster.fork(): Creates a new child process, with each child process running the same code.
cluster.on('exit'): Listens for a worker's exit event, allowing the master process to take action, such as restarting the worker.
